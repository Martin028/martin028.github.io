Owners typically saw the end result of the wire tayloring and connections, so every installation was required to look better than as if the electronics were installed at the factory while the boat was still being put together. Attention to detail was paramount, as some owners would even notice if zipties were not lined up in the same direction. Skills learned at this company include networking electronics on both NMEA0183 and the new standarnd NMEA2000 systems. Custom fabricated mounts for these electronics would sometimes need to be created in the field, and sacrificing design appeal and cleanliness of installation was never an option. Thinking outside the box was a daily requirement, and engineering new design solutions and systems was part of the job description.</font></p>

Starting off as a yard maintenance hire, responsibilities included moving wooden blocks and large boat stands to free up yard space, sweeping the parking lots and sidewalks, and dealing with the constant flow of trash and recyclables that any company will produce. Hard work and attention to detail allowed for promotion to the parts desk, assisting the parts manager. While working in the parts department, skills developed included customer service and satisfaction, efficient inventory control, and researching skills while finding obscure parts for boats and motors that may have a parts catalogue exclusively in Swedish. Learning the value of hard work was the greatest outcome of this job.</font></p>

I have completed everything from basic maintenance and oil changes to major overhauls including full turbo swaps, intake manifold removal, porting and polishing, ECU tuning, and handling modification. There is not much that makes me happier than completing some work on my car and taking it for a drive and seeing that everything I have done works, and works well.</font></p>
                                <p><font color="black"><b>Tournament Paintball</b><br>Tournament paintball is hard to describe. We don't play in the woods, and no one wears camo. On a small turf field with air filled plastic bunkers of various shapes, we shoot a constant stream of paint at 10.5 balls per second with incredible coordition between team members to lock out the opposing team from moving, allowing us to move. The adrenaline, chemistry and communication between team members, and the attention to detail that needs to go into every break out, every play, every move down field is addicting. There is no other sport like it.</font></p>

Seeing as how both of my co-ops completed at Wentworth Institute of Technology have been in the defense contracting and survivability field, it is safe to assume that the technology developed by the military and the history of innovation intrigues me more than almost anything else.</font></p>

These bins are filled to the brim with old projects and inventions, ideas that came to me in the most random of times that I decided to atempt to build on a whim. Cut up airsoft guns converted to run on a sprayer from an air compressor, game controllers with microchips soldered to the boards, cables of all varieties with one end missing after being converted for use with another system... The list can go on forever. Now that I can design new things in SolidWorks and I have the capability to 3D print them here at Wentworth, I forsee that collection growing even more. Hey, you never know when you may need an old air system from a Nerf gun for a project, right?</font></p>
